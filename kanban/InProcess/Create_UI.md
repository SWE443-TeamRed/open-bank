Title: Create UI

Description:

	Code the UI of the open bank android app based on the GUI mock ups created.
	Currently you don't need to have anything working, just make each screen
	look like the GUI mock ups. 
	
	Not much to test here but make sure everything you intended to show up, shows up.
	
	Note:
	 - Log-In screen should also include username and password prompts as well
		as buttons for creating a new account and forgeting your password or
		username.
	 - Once logged in users should be able to see their name and balance among
		other things
	 - Include links to seperate layouts for changing passwords, applying for
		a transaction, and viewing past transactions.
