Title: Create User Class

Description:

  Create an User class for the open-bank. The User class should
  hold information related to the owner and the owner's username/password.
  The User class should contain a username, password, owner's name,
  owner's e-mail, owner's phone number, and an unique ID. The User class
  should contain getter/setters for each attribute and an appropriate
  constructor. The User class can also own multiple accounts so such an
  association must be implmented. Finally, the User class should contain
  methods for loging in.
	
  Test any and all methods created to ensure they work as intended.
