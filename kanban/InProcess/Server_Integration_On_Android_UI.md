Title: Server Integration on Android UI

Description:

  Integrate the server into the Android application. Instead of using
  a singleton stored in the application, the app should send requests
  to the server and recieve information in response to the requests.
  Communicate with the server team to figure out what requests are 
  available and how to use them.
