Title: Improve Backend Functionality

Description:

  Create exhaustive unit testing for Account, User, Transaction,
  and JSON Serialization. These tests should test for all types of
  situations. YOU SHOULD CREATE YOUR TESTS WITH THE INTENT TO BREAK
  YOUR CODE. Be sure to also test transaction history. The tests for
  each file should also be stored in different test files. I should not
  see test checking the User's email in the same file as test checking 
  Transaction types. Any corrections to the code should be told immediately
  to the product owner and software architect so that they can inform related
  parties of the changes that will be committed.
