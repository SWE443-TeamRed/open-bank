Title: Create Transaction class

Description:

  Create an Transaction class for the open-bank. The Transaction class
  is used to store information about transactions that have occured.
  The Transaction class should contain a timestamp, the type of transaction
  (deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts, or seeding), the amount of
  money being moved, a unique ID, and the accounts involved. There should be
  getters and setters for each attribute.
  
  Note:
  - Each transaction should be related to at most two accounts. I suggest
  giving them the roles "sender" and "reciever".
