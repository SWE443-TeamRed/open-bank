Title: CreateAdminConsole 

Description:

	Create an admin console for the open bank system. The admin
	console should be a website that admins can log into in order
	to view transactions, accounts, and users of the system. The
	admin should be able to create transactions, accounts, and
	users from the admin console. When viewing transactions, accounts,
	or users admins should be able to filter their view so they
	only see what they want (objects will be filtered by their attributes).
	Admins should also be able to look at and change the fee for the bank.
	Any changes made by the admin should be applied to the bank located
	in the server.
