Title: Research QR Codes

Description:

	Research how to use QR codes for android and how they might be
	used to create transactions between two phones. Be sure to document
	all research so that others can understand it.
	
	Note:
	 - We were thinking that we could make one phone (the reciever only)
	   generate a code for the transaction so the other party can scan the
	   code and accept the transaction.
