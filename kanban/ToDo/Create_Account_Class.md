Title: Create Account Class

Description:

  Create an Account class for the open-bank. The Account class should
  hold information related to the owner of the account as well as be able
  to interact with the money stored in the account. The Account class should
  contain a username, password, owner's name, owner's e-mail, owner's
  phone number, an unique ID, and account balance. The Account class
  should contain getter/setters for each attribute and an appropriate
  constructor. Finally, the Account class should contain methods for
  depositing money, withdrawing money, transfering money between
  accounts, and seeding accounts. 
  
  Note: 
  - We may be encorporating a boolean flag to determine if the 
  account is an admin console.
  - Seeding for accounts is likely going to be a one time action that
  occurs when the account is first created. You may be able to perform
  this action in the constructor rather then creating a method for it.
