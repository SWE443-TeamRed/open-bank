Title: Create Database Class

Description:

  Create an Database class for the open-bank. The Database class stores
  all the accounts and transactions of the open bank. 
  
  Note:
  - We currently don't have any methods decided for this class yet
	- We should probably create methods to add accounts and transactions
	  to the database
	- We should probably also create methods to search through the database
	  for an account with a specific ID or username
	- We should probably also create methods to search through the transactions
	  for transactions with a specific ID or that involve specific account
